;;; Do environment analysis on the code in COMPONENT. This involves
;;; various things:
;;;  1. Make an ENVIRONMENT structure for each non-LET LAMBDA, assigning
;;;     the LAMBDA-ENVIRONMENT for all LAMBDAs.
;;;  2. Find all values that need to be closed over by each
;;;     environment.
;;;  3. Scan the blocks in the component closing over non-local-exit
;;;     continuations.
;;;  4. Delete all non-top-level functions with no references. This
;;;     should only get functions with non-NULL kinds, since normal
;;;     functions are deleted when their references go to zero.
